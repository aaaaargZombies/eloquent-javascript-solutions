# Issues

> I don't have access to an issue tracker so this will have to do.

- Need to automate `npm run update` but don't have internet so can't install anything to watch for changes in the src directory.
- `textarea` css needs work so that content fills the element rather than using the scroll.
- could do with a test markdown file to run the processing stuff against.
