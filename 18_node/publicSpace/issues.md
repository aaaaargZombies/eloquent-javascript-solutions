# Issues

> I don't have access to an issue tracker so this will have to do.

- Need to automate `npm run update` but don't have internet so can't install anything to watch for changes in the src directory.
- `textarea` css needs work so that content fills the element rather than using the scroll.
- I've thought about using the `string.replace(someRegex, "")` to strip the html tags but I will also need to take into acount escaped quotes, newlines, spacing.
- There's a lot of different markdowns out there, I think I should focus on a subset to start with and then work outwards as needed.
- Also the original markdown is 1500 lines of perl :o, could i modify a module to give me the out put I'm looking for?
- a link should trigger a `PUT` request if there is no page already.
- an image is a link but how should it handle the `PUT`?
